Log messages for debugging and tracking.
2. JSON Kafka Consumer
Create a new consumer script (json_consumer_huzaifa.py).
Copy the example Kafka JSON consumer into it.
Implement logic to process messages in real-time.
Add analytics or alerting features (e.g., detect a certain keyword in messages and trigger an alert).
3. CSV Kafka Producer

guide me on how to push to git

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide on how to push your project to GitHub:

Step 1: Set Up Git
If you haven‚Äôt already, install Git on your system:

Windows: Download and install Git from git-scm.com.
Mac: Git is pre-installed, but you can update it using Homebrew:
sh
Copy
Edit
brew install git
Linux: Install using:
sh
Copy
Edit
sudo apt install git  # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo dnf install git  # Fedora
Step 2: Clone the Repository (If Not Cloned Already)
If you haven‚Äôt cloned your repository yet, go to your GitHub repo and copy the SSH or HTTPS URL.

Then, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

sh
Copy
Edit
git clone <YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL>
cd <YOUR_REPO_NAME>
If you have already cloned it, just navigate to the folder:

sh
Copy
Edit
cd <YOUR_REPO_NAME>
Step 3: Create and Modify Files
Make sure you have the necessary files in your repository. You should have:

kotlin
Copy
Edit
üìÇ your_repo/
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ producers/
  ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ json_producer_huzaifa.py
  ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ csv_producer_huzaifa.py
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìÇ consumers/
  ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ json_consumer_huzaifa.py
  ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ csv_consumer_huzaifa.py
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data.csv
Modify and save your scripts as needed.

Step 4: Add the Changes to Git
Check which files have been changed:

sh
Copy
Edit
git status
You‚Äôll see a list of modified or new files. Add them to Git:

sh
Copy
Edit
git add .
The . adds all changes in the repo. If you want to add specific files, use:

sh
Copy
Edit
git add producers/json_producer_huzaifa.py
git add consumers/json_consumer_huzaifa.py
Step 5: Commit the Changes
Now, commit the changes with a meaningful message:

sh
Copy
Edit
git commit -m "Added custom Kafka JSON and CSV producers/consumers"
Step 6: Push to GitHub
If this is your first time pushing to this repository, make sure your branch is correct:

sh
Copy
Edit
git branch  # Check which branch you're on
git pull origin main  # Sync your repo with GitHub to avoid conflicts
Then, push your changes:

sh
Copy
Edit
git push origin main
If you're working on a different branch:

sh
Copy
Edit
git push origin <your-branch-name>
Step 7: Verify on GitHub
Go to your GitHub repository in a browser.
Refresh the page and check if the files were uploaded successfully.
Navigate to the Commit History to ensure your commit appears.
Bonus: Handling Errors
If you see authentication errors, set up your Git credentials:

sh
Copy
Edit
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your-email@example.com"
If you have two-factor authentication enabled, use a Personal Access Token instead of your password when pushing to GitHub. Generate one from GitHub Developer Settings.

Let me know if you run into any issues! üöÄ

Here's a well-structured README.md file for your project. It includes an introduction, setup instructions, and usage details.

Kafka Streaming Pipelines: CSV and JSON Producers & Consumers
Project Overview
This project demonstrates real-time data streaming using Apache Kafka. It includes:

A JSON Producer that sends structured messages to a Kafka topic.
A JSON Consumer that reads and processes the messages in real time.
A CSV Producer that streams temperature data from a CSV file.
A CSV Consumer that analyzes the incoming temperature data for anomalies.
This implementation is based on the Buzzline 03 Case example.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Apache Kafka
Python 3.x
Required Python libraries:
sh
Copy
Edit
pip install kafka-python pandas
Kafka Setup
Step 1: Start Kafka and Zookeeper
Navigate to your Kafka directory and run:

sh
Copy
Edit
bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
Then, in a new terminal window:

sh
Copy
Edit
bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
Step 2: Create Kafka Topics
sh
Copy
Edit
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic json_topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic csv_topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

bash
Copy
Edit
Sent: {'message': 'Kafka is amazing!', 'author': 'Huzaifa'}
Sent: {'message': 'Streaming data is powerful.', 'author': 'Bob'}
2Ô∏è‚É£ Run the JSON Consumer
This consumer reads messages from Kafka and processes them in real-time.

sh
Copy
Edit
python consumers/json_consumer_huzaifa.py
‚úî Expected Output:

bash
Copy
Edit
Received: {'message': 'Kafka is amazing!', 'author': 'Huzaifa'}
Received: {'message': 'Streaming data is powerful.', 'author': 'Bob'}
‚ö†Ô∏è ALERT: Detected a powerful message!
3Ô∏è‚É£ Run the CSV Producer
This producer reads data from data.csv and sends it to Kafka.

sh
Copy
Edit
python producers/csv_producer_huzaifa.py
‚úî Expected Output:

bash
Copy
Edit
Sent: {'timestamp': '2025-01-01 15:00:00', 'temperature': '70.4'}
Sent: {'timestamp': '2025-01-01 15:01:00', 'temperature': '70.8'}
4Ô∏è‚É£ Run the CSV Consumer
This consumer reads temperature data and alerts if it exceeds a threshold.

sh
Copy
Edit
python consumers/csv_consumer_huzaifa.py
‚úî Expected Output:

bash
Copy
Edit
Received: {'timestamp': '2025-01-01 15:00:00', 'temperature': '70.4'}
Received: {'timestamp': '2025-01-01 15:01:00', 'temperature': '70.8'}
‚ö†Ô∏è ALERT: High temperature detected!
Customization
Modify json_producer_huzaifa.py to send different types of messages.
Modify json_consumer_huzaifa.py to filter messages based on keywords.
Modify csv_producer_huzaifa.py to stream different types of sensor data.
Modify csv_consumer_huzaifa.py to detect anomalies (e.g., sudden temperature spikes).

Lessons Learned
Kafka is powerful for real-time streaming.
Producers and consumers work independently, making it easy to scale.
JSON and CSV processing require different approaches for real-time analytics.
